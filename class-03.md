You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box. You can also control the borders, margin, and padding for each box with CSS.

Block level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level. boxes. 

Legibility can be improved by controling the width of boxes containin text and leading.
