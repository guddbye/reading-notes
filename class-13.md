## Reading Notes

# React

The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability. A component encapsulates functionality and behaviors of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit. There are many standard component frameworks such as COM/DCOM, JavaBean, EJB, CORBA, .NET, web services, and grid services.

A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes. Each problem domain class (analysis) and infrastructure class (design) are explained to identify all attributes and operations that apply to its implementation. It also involves defining the interfaces that enable classes to communicate and cooperate.




# Characteristics of Components

Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
