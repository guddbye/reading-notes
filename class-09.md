## Reading Notes

# Chapter 7

Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside <form> element.
  
  Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
  
  Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are to the server.
  
  HTML5 introduces new form elements which makes it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
  
  # Chapter 14
  
  In addition to the CSS properties covered in the other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
  
  List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style-image properties.
  
  Tables cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. 
  
  ## Javascript Book
  
  # Chapter 6
  
  Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).
  
  Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.
  
  When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a Javascript function. When this function then changes the web page somehow, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. 
  
  You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen to all of the children of an element.
