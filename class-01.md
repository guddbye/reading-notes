## HTML Chapters

#Why It Matters
HTML is the base structure for any web page. HTML allows you to customize your website or build your theme from scratch. 
It also allows you to create and organize the elements of your website, like images, text, tables, or forms.

## Chapter 1

HTML page structure is set up with the <HTML> tag first, <BODY> tag second, any <HEADER> tags next, then whatever you would like to fill the body. 
  Then closing tags to complete the page. The <TITLE> of a page is just the name that the tab in your web broiwser will see. 
  
  Opening tags can carry attributes, which tells us more about the contnt of that element. 
  
  Attribrutes require a name and a value.
  
  To learn HTML you need to know what tags are availbale for you to use, what they do, and where they can go. 
  
  ## Chapter 8
  
  DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
  The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
  The <DIV> and <SPAN> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together. 
  The <META> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page. 
  
  ## Chapter 17
  
  The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure. 
  The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <DIV> elements).
  To make HTML5 elements work in older browswers, extra JS is needed. 
  
  ## Chapter 18
  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a website. (Or wire caging)
  Design is about communication and planning. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you arae trying to tell them. 
  You can differentiate between pieces of informaiton using size, color, ad style. 
  You can use groupings and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
