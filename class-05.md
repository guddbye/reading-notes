> You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of in image. 

> You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate formate. 

# Chapter 11

> Color not only brings your website to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions. 

> There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex code, and color names.

> It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content)

> CSS3 also allows you to specify colors with HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


# Chapter 12

> There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.

> There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

> If you want to use a wider range of typefaces, there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

> You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

> You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
