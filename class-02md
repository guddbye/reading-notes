# Chapter 2 "Text"
HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

They also provide semantic information(e.g. where emhpasis should be placed, the defitinition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation.)

## Chapter 10 Introduction to CSS
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rules applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

Different types of slelectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

#Chapter 2
Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the cariable and giving it a name. Programmers say that you declare the variable. 

If a variable name is more thatn one word, it is usually written in camelCase. This means the first word is all lowercase and any subsequent workds have their first letter capitalized. 

Until you assign a value to a variable, programmers say the value is undefined. 
# Chapter 4
The if...else statement checks a condition. If it resolves to true the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves a false the second code block is run instead. 
An if statment only runs a statement if the condition is true. 
An if...else statment runs one set of code if the condition is true or different set if it is false.
