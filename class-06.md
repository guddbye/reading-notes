## Reading Notes 06

# Chapter 3

The new keyword and object constructor creates a blank object. You can add properties and methods to the object. 

To update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets. They work on objects created using literal or constructor notation. To delete a property, use the delete keyword. 

Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. Objects constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object's properties and methods. 

# Chapter 5

The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.

DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 

Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a NodeList.
